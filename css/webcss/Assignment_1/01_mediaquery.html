    <p id="para">Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's media type (such as print vs. screen) or other features or characteristics such as screen resolution or orientation, aspect ratio, browser viewport width or height, user preferences such as preferring reduced motion, data usage, or transparency.CSS Media queries are a way to target browser by certain characteristics, features, and user preferences, then apply styles or run other code based on those things.The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries. With it, you specify a media query and a block of CSS to apply to the document if and only if the media query matches the device on which the content is being used.CSS 2.1 defines the following media groups: continuous or paged. visual, audio, speech, or tactile. grid (for character grid devices), or bitmap. interactive (for devices that allow user interaction), or static (for those that do not).You may use as many media queries as you would like in a CSS file. Note that you may use the and operator to require multiple queries to be true, but you have to use the comma (,) as the or operator to separate groups of multiple queries.</p>
